Eventually subs would just start to continuously drop and have been dropping ever since. Viewers started calling it the H2.9 Podcast because of this.

Before the Podcast a video was made about him on the Ethan and Hila YouTube channel. Eventually he was brought onto the Podcast as a guest, with the episode receiving a lot of criticism, some even considering it the worst episode of all time. However, in recent years Jimmie has once again come back on the show and it has led to some of the funniest segments that podcast has to offer. While he himself is controversial and not particularly funny, the interactions the crew and guests have with him are hilarious, and viewers on the whole agree that Jimmie means well... He's just got those old timey jokes that, you know... Suck. Jimmie probably deserves and entire page to himself given how prominent of a role he has played on the Podcast, but until then feel free to check out the related links - There's a lot of them!",

Later, in 2019, an AI would dub the only redeeming quality on Ethan's face to be his hairline! Since then, fans have dubbed him the hairline king and it is common knowledge that Ethan absorbs the hairlines of his enemies in order to maintain such a lucious head of hair.",

When Howie came on the H3 Podcast, HungerFF called in and prolapsed LIVE ON AIR for Howie - Much to his surprise!

In recent years Lovebot was put out of commission and for a long time Love resided prominently on a TV in the background. Dan did resurrect Lovebot in a fitting new body to impress Pokimane, leading to her putting a picture of Love in the background of the stream.
