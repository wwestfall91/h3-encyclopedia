  "In the midst of the Ryan Kavanaugh drama a meme was born that Ryan kinda looks like Harvey Weinstein, the writing was on the wall, the public was confused! So Ethan and Love created a solution to this problem - [doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com](https://doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com/). The public rejoiced! _Finally, we can breath again_ one user said. \n Of course, ~~Harvey Weinstein~~ Ryan Kavanaugh would not take this sitting down and in December of 2021 he would file a third lawsuit against Ethan and try to get the site taken down. He would not succeed, however, and the site remains active to this day and has been shown to many guests!",

In the past Ethan has been very staunchly against the streamies due to his pent up aggression to Jay Shetty being a superior podcast host. However, this year was going to be different. He would play by their rules. He would attend the streamies himself. He would gather the troops. He would storm into that establishment and claim his rightful place atop their throne of lies. Aaaaand he sent a body double.",

  "A wiki moderator that was dragged into Ryan Kavanaugh drama. In November of 2021  a wikipedia user named *RK777713* began erasing the 'Controversial' section of Ryan Kavanaugh's Wikipedia page. When mods noticed, a heated discussion between them began, inevitably leading to the mods banning the account. \n It was suspected that this account could be Ryan Kavanaugh, and this theory would only be further proven when Kav Kav would grow increasingly unhinged in the following months. One such bounty was Ryan putting out a tweet stating that he would reward 25k to anyone who could prove that Ethan was Throast.",

However, Chestnuts would be forever tainted when Ethan told Zach to play it overtop a very emotional video by qtcinderella.

Kelly is now in jail for sex trafficking charges there's not denying the song is a bop. Ethan sings it multiple times a year and multiple skits and hilarious moments have spawned from the song.",
