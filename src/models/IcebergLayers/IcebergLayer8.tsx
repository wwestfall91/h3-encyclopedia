  "Have you ever wanted to take drive barefoot, video tape it, and make money doing so? Then C-Man, and his website, https://www.barefootbrothersdrive.com/, is your ticket! In October of 2021 a peculiar ad surfaced on YouTube with this exact business offer. A man named Liam would take up the offer, and call into the Podcast discussing the drama that happened because of it. Eventually C-Man and Liam would confront one another on the Podcast, and it would be revealed that Liam was trolling the entire time. As an act of good faith, Love would make a website called https://www.barefootbrothersdrivesmotorcycle.com/ that contained a single video of Love riding a motorcycle in his barefeet. The site is still active, but the video is no longer available.",
