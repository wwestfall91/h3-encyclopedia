  "Patrice Wilson is a music producer who wrote Rebecca Black's song Friday (along with many others). In the early days of the Podcast Ethan would often rag on him for being a creep. In November of 2017 Patrice would post a livestream with a countdown to December 1st with h3h3 in the title. Ethan would show this to Post Malone on Podcast #39, and afterwards fans would point out that the live stream has began to change. This led to a whole series of creepy events that would genuinely freak Ethan out.",

  "Ethan and Hila are long time fans of the Bachelor series, which led them to create a series of segments called the BacH3lor. Ian would be the bachelor looking for love, and he would immediately break the rules and drama would unfold between Ethan and him. There were only 2 segments before the show was cancelled. They tried again later with Trish as the BacH3lorette. It once again failed, and was dubbed a cursed segment. Ironically, both Trisha and Ian found their current SO's through these segments, but not at all in the way they were suppose to.",

The relationship between Shoe and the Podcast has been a rollercoaster and whether Shoenice likes or hates Ethan and the Crew truly seems to depend on the day.

He is completely serious, and for awhile the crew often made gags out of it. Lately Ethan has come out against doing this though - As ridiculous as it may seem, it is something Zach truly struggles with constantly and should not be made light of... For the most part.",

Ethan said no, and that Lil Tracy needs to stfu and deal with it. Lil Tracy then wrote a series of negative tweets at Ethan.

A large contributing factor to this is flushable baby wipes. It turns out flushable does not mean decomposable, and they build up into these horrific creatures. He has since sworn off baby wipes and spreads the good word to anyone still using them.",
