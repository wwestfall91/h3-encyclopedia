Peace & Love	PeaceAndLove, Iceberg, Layer1	https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ringo-starr-peace-portrait-billboard-2016-1548.jpg	In the summer of 2020 Ethan and Hila watched a video made by Ringo Starr. The video declared that after the 20th of October he would not be accepting any more fan mail. He ushered his fans please, do not send any fan mail to ANY address. He has TOO MUCH to do. No more fanmail. Anyway, peace and love, peace and love. Ethan loved the peace and love attitude and started quoting it. It would become a staple on the show and among fans, and led to Ethan eventually re-enacting the entire video.
Frenemies	Frenemies, Iceberg, Layer1	https://junkee.syd1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/frenemies.jpg	A web show hosted by Ethan Klein and Trisha Paytas - It ran for 39 episodes from Septemper 15, 2020 - June 8, 2021 before its inevitable crash and burned. There's simply too much to cover in-depth here, and this will eventually be worthy of it's own page. For now, I'm sure you know how the rest goes.
Wikifeet	Iceberg, Layer4, FootSoldiers	https://h3out.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/85993e3fa366120a2f2b7ed718375dd5-1024x458.jpg	In the March of 2020 Ethan would host a segment on the show about wikifeet.com, a popular website that hosts feet pictures of celebrities. This would lead to fans mass-rating Ethan's feet a 5 star, leading to Ethan being #1 on the site, and the title 'Foot Soldiers' given to fans of the show. However, mods began to catch wind of these shenanigans and Ethan would be banned from the site entirely, his page, deleted. In retaliation, Ethan went undercover as Ethan Kleinschroth and sent word to his fans to boost him again. Ethan Kleinschroth would reach and all time high score of 7.42 out of 5 before once again being banned from the site. The name Foot Soldiers became a staple to name members of the fandom, and are still echoed across these dusty halls to this day.
FAMILY	Iceberg, FAMILY, Layer3	https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vin-Diesel-look-a-likes-family.jpg	A video of Vin Diesel lookalikes repeatedly saying 'FAMILY' surfaced and was watched on the Pod. After this the crew and chat began chanting 'FAMILY' throughout the show. While it's not done as much these days, it does still prop up from time-to-time.
Uncle Gabe	Iceberg, Layer1, UncleGabe	https://image.mux.com/HvSmr3iX3vntGhZemUwzAQvgl66TV013CvJjZheoJNog/thumbnail.jpg?height=650	Uncle Gabe (Previously known as White Claw Gabe) is a famous Tik Tok personality that LOVES FRIDAY BABY!!! Ethan started watching his clips on the show and eventually had him call in. This eventually led to him calling in every Friday, and he has been a staple on Friday shows ever since!
H2.9	Iceberg, Layer4, H2.9	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z1d3LJ9dT6I/maxresdefault.jpg	For a time there was a running joke on the show that they were going to hit 3 million subscribers this episode. Fans would subscribe during the episode, getting them over 3 million subs, and then unsub, brining them back down to 2.9m. Eventually subs would just start to continuously drop and have been dropping ever since. Viewers started calling it the H2.9 Podcast because of this. The podcast has dropped as low as 2.87 since then, but typically subscribers are in the 2.9m range, not yet surpassing 3m since.
The Jersey Outlaw	Iceberg, TheJerseyOutlaw, Layer1	https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pressofatlanticcity.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/a6/1a632410-0ecc-11e5-b956-bb096e606be1/557721138f97e.image.jpg	The Jersey Outlaw, AKA Jimmie Lee, AKA James Weiner, is a crazy dentist gone comedian who has been a staple on the show over the years. Before the Podcast a video was made about him on the Ethan and Hila YouTube channel. Eventually he was brought onto the Podcast as a guest, with the episode receiving a lot of criticism, some even considering it the worst episode of all time. Years later Jimmie found himself once again back on the show, and for a time was one of the most prominent and frequent guests on the Podcast! While his jokes weren't particularly funny, the interactions from the crew led to some of the funniest moments the show has to offer. However, this all came to a head when controversy struck and Jimmie found himself in hot water over various sexual harrassment controversies. The crew confronted him when he broke into the studio, uninvited, and since then Jimmie has been banned from the show. 
Pride Minute	Iceberg, Layer3, PrideMinute	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nrk1GL921UU/maxresdefault.jpg	Jordan Peterson once said that Pride Month is, quite simple, TOO DAMN LONG. And so, Ethan and crew created Pride MINUTE so that that we get to be ourselves for absolutely no more than 60 seconds! The gag lasted awhile and many Pride Minutes were shared for months after this, however, these days the gag seems to have run its course and Pride Minute hasn't happened in... A (pride) minute!
The Hairline King	Iceberg, Layer2, HairlineKing	https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/rockcms/2022-10/221023-xi-jinping-jm-0926-05d630.jpg	Ethan's hairline has always been prominent and glowing, and in recent years he has been dubbed 'The Hairline King'. However, with humble beginnings, Ethan's hairline was discussed much prior to him becoming the King, going all the way back to 2017 when he and Jackfilms talked about the curse that is his hairline. Later, in 2019, an AI would dub the only redeeming quality on Ethan's face to be his hairline! Since then, fans have dubbed him the hairline king and it is common knowledge that Ethan absorbs the hairlines of his enemies in order to maintain such a lucious head of hair.
The Prolapsed Anus	Iceberg, Layer2, Prolapse	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fGD_aFm74Ek/maxresdefault.jpg	Over the summer of 2022 Howie Mandel posted a picture of a mans fully prolapsed anus on TikTok for the world to see. Ethan LOVED this and ran with it to the end of the earth. He showed it to all his guests, and eventually confronted Howie about it on Howies podcast. When Howie came on the H3 Podcast, HungerFF called in and prolapsed LIVE ON AIR for Howie - Much to his surprise! Ethan has since showed the prolapse to various guests on the show, and in an unexpected twist, Howie himself has taken up the mantel of showing the video to guests on his show as well! What does the future hold for the prolapse? Only time will tell.
Lovebot	Iceberg, Layer3, LoveBot	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TEEHnZ1U0r4/maxresdefault.jpg	Lovebot was created so that Love, who once lived in Sweden could be apart of the show. During this time, Lovebot was constantly used as a gag in all sorts of ways. Eventually AB beat the shit out of him so badly that the little guy had to be retired. Everyone saw it. Dan did eventually ressurect Lovebot, fitting a new body to impress Pokimane. This lead to her putting a picture of Love in the background of the stream. Since then, Love has officially moved to America and there is no sign of Lovebot re-emerging anytime soon.
The Steamy Awards	Iceberg, Layer3, Steamys	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tMg0kf-Q0A8/maxresdefault.jpg	A yearly segment that is meant to be a parody of the Streamy awards. The co-host(s) change every year, and are cursed if they take on the role, always getting cancelled in the year that follows. This year Ethan attended the Streamy's in person AND THEY FUCKED HIM!! Because of this we do not know what the future holds for the Steamy's, but we can be sure that it's going to something petty as hell, and we cannot wait to find out.
Triller Lawsuits	Iceberg, Layer2, Triller	https://i0.wp.com/musically.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/triller.png	In April of 2021 Jake Paul had his fight against Ben Askren, to which Ethan joked about pirating the fight on Instagram. He then showed a clip of the fight in the following podcast, to which Triller decided to combat by suing Ethan for rebroadcasting the event. A few months later, Triller sued Hila, and a few months after that a third lawsuit was filed. This topic deserves a page within itself, but for now enjoy the related links below to get you up to speed with the gist of the situation!
Dans Sexy Mouse	Iceberg, Layer4, DansMouse	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_KdkRh-Yzk/hq720.jpg	No one knew for awhile, but Dan's mouse has a voice, and it's sexy as hell. Many in the chat thirst over Dan's mouse on the daily, and for awhile the crew played the gag out. However, these days Dan has showed his disdane for that sexy mouse of his, and we haven't heard that silky smooth voice in quite some time. Many remain hopeful that one day we'll get to hear it once again. Ethan also got sick and impersonated the mouse, so... There's that too if you're into it?
Five Percent	Iceberg, Layer4, FivePercent	https://tvovermind.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kalli-Metz.jpg	On the final episode of Frenemies Trisha complained about how Ethan took 5% of payment for the show. This was to pay for production costs, in which Ethan and Crew were handling everything. After Frenemies officially ended, Trisha's sister would make a video talking about him taking that 5%. This has led to soundbites of various other people also saying 5%, such as Joe Rogan.
The Scorpion Chair	Iceberg, Layer3, ScorpionChair	https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAMcMfm8qu9zsS2OFGIT4YG4q38=/0x0:1920x1080/2000x1333/filters:focal(960x540:961x541)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21878541/scorpion_chair.jpg	In 2021 the Podcast moved to a new studio. Dan used this as leverage to try and get a newer, more badass, chair. There were various iterations of what the chair would be, but in the end it was the STEEL STRIKER, forged in the deepest recesses of a neutron star. Well, as it turns out, the chair was lacking in the comfort area. After two long years of Dan dealing with it, the Crew finally decided enough was enough, and in 2023 the Back-chelor segment was done to save Dan from a lifetime of backpain! In this segment Dan got to choose what his new chair would be, and he landed on a recreation of Captain Pickards chair from Star Trek. Currently, the chair is currently being FORGED IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF A NEUTRON STAR, but we can expect it to be in the studio sometime in the near future!
WAN	Iceberg, Layer5, WAN	https://i.insider.com/6362955db1760d0019d98dda?width=700	In July 2022 Ethan would watch some of Jidion's awful prank videos, leading to a response from Jidion himself. In the response Jidion was highly critical of Ethan, however, he took a liking to Dan and called him W DAN, or WAN for short.
FLOCKA	Iceberg, Layer5, FLOCKA	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/h3podcast/images/7/7a/AB_ayad.png	One day Zach was unable to make it to the show, and thus AB took over on the soundboard. However, not wanting to truly commit to competing with Zach, AB only used a single soundbite... FLOCKA!
Ethan is 42	Iceberg, Layer3, EthansBirthday	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4rzUXpWEAMfmm9.jpg	Ethan was in denial on his 40th birthday, believing he was only 37. By his 42nd birthday he was still in denial. The crew often has to remind him that he is, in fact, 42 years old.
Majority Female Audience	Iceberg, Layer3, FemaleAudience	https://womenentrepreneursgrowglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/womenworldwidewegg.jpg	Back in the day the show was watched primarily by men. However, after Frenemies there was an uptick in women viewers. As of September 2022 the audience was 60% women.
Shoutout to His Family	Iceberg, Layer4, Shoutouttohisfamily	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5ZgEtgxxg0/maxresdefault.jpg	In May of 2020 a famous DJ named David Guetta made a tribute song to George Floyd's family, starting the song by saying 'shoutout to his family'. They watched it on the podcast and it became a very popular soundbite, eventually winning the first ever soundbite tournament! The channel also recently made a lore video about this, so check that out!
AUDIO AUDIO AUDIO	Iceberg, Layer3, AUDIOAUDIOAUDIO	https://www.24-7pressrelease.com/assets/attachments/050/press_release_distribution_0500031_190169.jpg	A popular soundbite that originated from when Jimmie Lee, Zach, and Cameron went out on the streets of LA.

Both Hundar and Luckyboy (ABs boxing coach) were guests on the Podcast to talk about his fight. AB once again fought in Creator Clash 2023, this time going up against the monster that is Dad. AB once again lost, but he put up a hell of a fight! The aftermath of the Dad fight was less amicable than the Hundar fight, and beef ensued with Dad, Ethan, and AB.
Joker Brain	Iceberg, Layer4, JokerBrain	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DpZb0ZrJPUk/maxresdefault.jpg	One of the oldest ongoing jokes on the show. It started in December of 2020 when Zach declared he had a 'Joker Brain'. Since then merch has been sold surrounding Joker Brain, a Joker Brain NFT was created, and Zach has dressed up as the Joker multiple times. However, in September of 2022 Zach had his Joker Brain title revoked. It was given to Lena - The true joker brain of the crew. Zach does not agree.
ABs Burrito	Iceberg, Layer4, ABsBurrito	https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.3775422350.8345/flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.jpg	During an ad read for HelloFresh, a picture of a burrito that AB had made was put on the screen. However, it was suppose to be a quesadilla. This prompted input from the chat to explain how much AB fucked up the recipe, and the meme has remained ever since.
P&P	Iceberg, Layer3, P&P	https://justatic.com/profile-images/1527786-1601928357-s.jpg	A TikTok Lawyer that Ethan stumbled upon and found absolutely hilarious. Since then P&P has called into the show multiple times, and even made an appearance on the live show. LETS GO!

It started with humble beginnings, and eventually Zach added music to the segment. For a time, Zach was quite often the instigator, playing the Godfather music to get Ethan riled up. However, these days the Godfather impression is seen less and less.
Weights in Fish	Iceberg, Layer4, WeightsinFish	https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/mpx/2704722219/2022_10/FISH-gjruah.jpg	In October of 2022 a TikTok went viral that revealed a team fo fisherman cheating by putting weights in fish to increase their numbers. This led to a hilarious soundbite that is often used on the show.
Ethans Bomb Threat	Iceberg, Layer4, BombThreats	https://thumb.ac-illust.com/c4/c4f5502ca9eded16935a1a70743ecc9e_t.jpeg	*cough* Ethan said someone should bomb the NRA and the episode got banned *cough*
Zilly Zonka	Iceberg, Layer4, ZillyZonka	https://media.tenor.com/jxqPmuV3lFQAAAAe/h3-zilly-zonka.png	When Ethan was trying Mr. Beast's chocolate bars on the show the crew came up with an ellaborate ploy to create a fake golden ticket, and a fake website to submit the ticket on, so that Ethan could get ZILLY ZONK'D! He made a re-appearance later when AB and Ian made a fake cryptocurrency.
$20,000,000,000 compound	Iceberg, Layer4, 20BillionDollarCompound	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8EuOscSvwQ/sddefault.jpg	The Leftovers set started as a 3 million dollar set, but with each episode Ethan continues to pump more and more of his life savings into its defenses.

DoesRyanKavanaughLook LikeHarveyWeinstein.com	Iceberg, Layer5, RyanHarvey.com	https://media.tenor.com/o-Y3gxFGSN0AAAAM/h3-h3after-dark.gif	In the midst of the Ryan Kavanaugh drama a meme was born that Ryan kinda looks like Harvey Weinstein, the writing was on the wall, the public was confused! So Ethan and Love created a solution to this problem - [doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com](https://doesryankavanaughlooklikeharveyweinstein.com/). The public rejoiced! _Finally, we can breath again_ one user said. \n Of course, ~~Harvey Weinstein~~ Ryan Kavanaugh would not take this sitting down and in December of 2021 he would file a third lawsuit against Ethan and try to get the site taken down. He would not succeed, however, and the site remains active to this day and has been shown to many guests!
Lou	Iceberg, Layer4, Lou	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/h3podcast/images/2/24/ZachLewis.jpg	It is well known that Zach has an alter Ego - Or, well, a few of them - But one in particular is known as Lou!  He occassionally shows up on the show, sporting his red jacket.
Fake Ethan	Iceberg, Layer5, EthanBodyDouble	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1663636443275857920/I9XjlEWX_400x400.jpg	In 2022 the H3 Podcast was nominated for a streamy award once again. In the past Ethan has been very staunchly against the streamies due to his pent up aggression to Jay Shetty being a superior podcast host. However, this year was going to be different. He would play by their rules. He would attend the streamies himself. He would gather the troops. He would storm into that establishment and claim his rightful place atop their throne of lies. Aaaaand he sent a body double.
Throast	Iceberg, Layer5, Throast	https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wikipedia-logo.png	A wiki moderator that was dragged into Ryan Kavanaugh drama. In November of 2021  a wikipedia user named *RK777713* began erasing the 'Controversial' section of Ryan Kavanaugh's Wikipedia page. When mods noticed, a heated discussion between them began, inevitably leading to the mods banning the account. \n It was suspected that this account could be Ryan Kavanaugh, and this theory would only be further proven when Kav Kav would grow increasingly unhinged in the following months. One such bounty was Ryan putting out a tweet stating that he would reward 25k to anyone who could prove that Ethan was Throast.
Saudi Benefactor	Iceberg, SaudiBenefactor, Layer7	https://orientxxi.info/IMG/logo/salmane-2.jpg	There is one particular chatter on streams that will send large amounts of gifted subs under various different names. For a time, the benefactor faded away, but eventually re-emerged! The crew was estatic and to this day the chat continues to receieves hundreds of gifted subs from this mysterious person!
Chestnuts	Iceberg, Layer3, ChestnutGate	https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-2023-02-15t152801-661.jpg	Ethan was late on getting on the anucatittawan train, but what he lacked in time he made up for in quantity and he became obssessed with anuc's cover of *Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire*, playing the clip at various moments throughout the late January 2023 shows. However, Chestnuts would be forever tainted when Ethan told Zach to play it overtop a very emotional video by qtcinderella. The entire situation was met with great backlash and was dubbed CHESTNUT GATE.
R Kelly Passports	Iceberg, Layer5, RKellyPassportSong	https://media.tenor.com/uxAu4a7TDGEAAAAe/passport-shots.png	One of the longest running jokes on the Podcast. Back in March of 2019 Ethan presented a video of R. Kelly trying to recruit women in Ethiopia to come back to America with him. While R. Kelly is now in jail for sex trafficking charges there's not denying the song is a bop. Ethan sings it multiple times a year and multiple skits and hilarious moments have spawned from the song.
Thats Not Fraud	Iceberg, Layer5, ThatsNotFraud	https://media.wired.com/photos/5c48957da730093fb4f2d92d/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Culture_FyreFestival3.jpg	Back in 2019 a documentary about the disastrous Fire Festival landed on Netflix. Ja Rule was famously apart of the scam, and while trying to save face during the fallout he proudly declared 'That's not Fraud. I would call that... Uhhhh... False Advertising!'. To this day whenever fraud is talked about on the show you can be sure that Ja Rule will be there to add to the conversation.
The Chew Zone	Iceberg, Layer5, TheChewZone	https://media.tenor.com/3uzBwnDo790AAAAe/h3-ethan-klein-drunk.png	Ethan's a disgusting FREAK who chews into the microphone. The Chew Zone was created to help alleviate that. It didn't help, but it is a funny gag that will occassionally make an appearance.
Apology Podium	Iceberg, Layer6, ApologyPodium	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hz-hpoLzN_I/hq720.jpg	The apology podium was created to apologize in front of a podium, but let us make it clear that it is ONLY USED FOR SARCASTIC APOLOGIES! The Apology Podium MUST NOT BE USED for genuine apologies. Dan explains it all below.
Beautiful World	Iceberg, Layer5, BeautifulWorld	https://hips.hearstapps.com/esq.h-cdn.co/assets/16/51/1482598255-vin-diesel.jpg?resize=640:*	Back in 2016 Vin Diesel was drunk out of his mind and decided it would be a good idea to be an absolute creep to a cute girl who was trying to interview him. The interview devolved into him harassing her again and again. One such line that he used was 'When did this turn into beautiful world?!'
Mayo Memes	Iceberg, Layer9, MayoMemes	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1TPT_QXsAA9nuW.jpg	For a time mayonaisse was a consistent theme throughout on the H3 Podcast's. Sure, today you might hear about *mayoing up Dans Dome*, or perhaps the Thanksgiving food will include homage to the simpler times. Times when Mayo Meme's reigned supreme. And they all began in an unexpected place... With Horsey Sauce.
Andrew Tate Cease & Desist	Iceberg, Layer6, AndrewTateCeaseandDesist	https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/043/388/andrewtateshocked.jpg	Ethan used to talk about Andrew Tate a lot, and he does not hold back any punches. When he talks about Andrew he makes it very clear what a piece of shit he is. Andrew did not appreciate this and apparently had, had enough and a Cease and Desist was sent declaring they STOP TALKING ABOUT ANDREW. They did not.
Brad the Bull	Iceberg, Layer5, BradtheBull	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1224544224919486464/j8AEy4IN_400x400.jpg	Ryan Kavanaugh is many things. Among those, he is a man who loves to be CUCKED (allegedly). Brad the Bull is a mighty man that did just that and bulled his wife. Well, ex-wife. During the interview with Bryce Hall Ethan's dream finally came true and he came face-to-facetime with Brad himself! And from that came one of the best one-liners the show has ever seen. I'll let you experience it for yourself.
Craigsmas	Iceberg, Layer3, Craigsmas	https://media.tenor.com/iXBrjvLDz3QAAAAe/craigsmas-craigsmas-h3.png	Craigsmas began in December of 2020. It began with Ian trying to buy the crew ridiculous items for CHEAP on Craigs List. It has become a yearly tradition, the items each year getting increasingly more cursed.
Content Court	Iceberg, Layer2, ContentCourt	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XsI2yDSZjOY/maxresdefault.jpg	While Content Court has seen a slight resurgent recently, there was a time when Content Courts were dropping on the regular. It consisted of the crew in a courtroom with a plaintiff and a defendant. They would pick a content creator and present their cases on whether or not they should be charged. But Judge Ethan is not easily convinced.
I just peed in my basement	Iceberg, Layer5, IJustPeedinmyBasement	https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DSbJRHImpS7XzZOOZWAtjDuDSg=/1400x1400/filters:format(png)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9767163/Screen_Shot_2017_11_28_at_12.59.38_PM.png	The Quartering is a right-leaning YouTuber that gets brought up fairly frequently on the show, and he's... A character, to put it lightly.  One day his wife went out for pizza without him and in retaliation he decided he would do the unthinkable - PEE IN HIS BASEMENT. He is also shit himself in Wal-Mart!
Dink Doink	Iceberg, Layer4, DinkDoink	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZIwz3JbnqAc/maxresdefault.jpg	A crytocurrency and yet another one of Jake Paul's scams to suck his fans dry. To help advertise it they made a bunch of god-awful animations in the style of South Park because... Why not? They also sang during these, and the songs are also horrendous. But at the same time, it's kind of a bop, huh?
The Ban of Ethan Klein	Iceberg, Layer8, thebanofethanklein.com	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6_kP1HuepQ/hq720.jpg	A website made by Ryan Kavanaugh to attempt to counter DoesRyanKavanaughLookLikeHarveyWeinstein.com. It only last a few months, and is no longer active.

AI Ian	Iceberg, Layer6, AiIan	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1301590674647724040/cXaTOace_400x400.jpg	In September of 2020 an Artificial Intelligence of Ian was created. He was faulty straight from the get go and a bit of a dick, but they kept him around for awhile. Many but they kept him around awhile and was often a great defendant on Content Court.
EthansFeet.com	Iceberg, Layer7, EthansFeet.com	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1467926213146546179/XyrC1Ow8_400x400.jpg	After the great WikiFeet War ended and Ethan was banned from the site entirely, Love created a website to forever solidify Ethans beautiful little manlets in the history books.
Bull Penis Staff	Iceberg, Layer6, BullPenisStaff	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/h3podcast/images/4/4f/Dan%27s_bull_penis_staff.png	In September of 2022 Liver King was a guest on LeftOvers. In an attempt to live the primal lifestyle, Ethan and Hasan ate a bull penis. It was gross. Anyway, Sam played the ol' dick-in-resin trick and made a cane for Dan with it! It's squishy.
Nathaniel Klansman	Iceberg, Layer7, NathanielKlansman	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LKgeKe3VG-o/maxresdefault.jpg	Nathaniel Klansman started as a just a good ol' fashion southern boy. But as time pressed on, the dark secrets of Nathaniel began to come to light. Nathaniel is not a good man. Nathaniel has done things - Unimaginable things. But when those storm clouds roll in and the rain starts comin' down, those secrets bubble to the surface for all to see. OOHHHH-EEEEE. That's right, mhmmmmm.
The Feeding Window	Iceberg, Layer9, TheFeedingWindow	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1716913295062601728/w2ejQtHe_400x400.jpg	The feeding window was a failed attempt for Ethan to lose weight.

He prolapses his anus at will, and prolapsed LIVE for Howie Mandel. An homage was made on the Podcast called The Clockwork Rosebud. Only a few have had the opportunity to watch the film, but they all response with tears in their eyes at the beauty of the picture. Hunger would later make a fleshlight of his prolapse, and get in some hot water with the fanbase when he accidentally forgot to remove some inappropriate things from his background - That call-in has since been removed for... Obvious reasons.

Then C-Man, and his website, https://www.barefootbrothersdrive.com/, is your ticket! In October of 2021 a peculiar ad surfaced on YouTube with this exact business offer. A man named Liam would take up the offer, and call into the Podcast discussing the drama that happened because of it. \n Eventually C-Man and Liam would confront one another on the Podcast, and it would be revealed that Liam was trolling the entire time. As an act of good faith, Love would make a website called https://www.barefootbrothersdrivesmotorcycle.com/ that contained a single video of Love riding a motorcycle in his barefeet. The site is still active, but the video is no longer available.

This became a re-occurring segment on the show where Ethan would show Hila bad tattoo's to see if they could find an even worse tattoo. For years Ben Afflecks tattoo would reign supreme as the worst tattoo, but eventually it would be de-throned by none other than Ed Sheeran.

In December of 2020 the candle would be sold, raising $8,000 for prostate cancer.

There would be a stream where chat got to choose what scooter Ethan should buy and The Gatsby would be the victor! \n For a brief period of time guests would ride the scooter onto the set at the start of the show, however this was short lived due to Bobby Lee being an absolute maniac. which would end up being The Gatsby.  Many skits would include The Gatsby, but it has begun to appear less and less over the years.

She had a YouTube channel where she would film herself cruising around in public on her scooter to record evidence of people mistreating her as a handicapped person. Unfortunately it would be revealed in recent years that Mobility Mary has passed. Ethan and crew attempted to get her scooter, but unfortunately missed the mark on that one.

Ghost Stories	Iceberg, Layer9, GhostStories	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xGamy9dHfOk/hq720.jpg	In the early days of the Podcast Ethan and Hila would always ask their guests if they had any paranormal experiences that they would like to share.

There have been 3 BacH3lor's in total:  1. Ian was the first, but almost immediately disaster would strike! He began breaking the rules and talking to a girl behind the scenes. Dama would unfold between Ethan and him - There were only 2 segments before the show was cancelled.  2. Trisha was the second, and only current BacH3lorette. It once again failed, and was dubbed a cursed segment, until... 3. Jeff Wittek be the 3rd BacH3lor and he saw things through to the very end! ...  Ironically, Trisha and Ian both broke the rules yet ended up with their current SO's. Jeff, the only one who played by the rules, wasn't so lucky. Coincidence?!

The relationship between Shoe and the Podcast has been a rollercoaster and whether Shoenice likes or hates Ethan and the Crew truly seems to depend on the day. He's been brought onto the pod multiple times in the past, but lately has not been mentioned much.

CCR Curse	Iceberg, Layer7, CCRCurse	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival_1968.jpg	Zach has a phobia against the band Clarence Clearwater Revival. He believes that hearing their song or mentioning their name gives everyone bad luck. He is completely serious, and for awhile the crew often made gags out of it. Lately Ethan has come out against doing this though - As ridiculous as it may seem, it is something Zach truly struggles with constantly and should not be made light of... For the most part.
Lil' Tracy Beef	Iceberg, Layer10, LilTracyBeef	https://fastly-s3.allmusic.com/artist/mn0003670382/400/sRMlAmHpLaCAH6-J0jfuRCpQg_7iAU1wjqLgK_xGXts=.jpg	Back when the song Old Town Road was the most popular song on the planet a discussion arose around whether it was stolen from Lil Tracy.

Fatburgs	Iceberg, Fatburgs, Layer11	https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4571474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Another-massive-fatburg-found-under-London.jpg	Before Ethan got a bidet, he used to swear by flushable baby wipes at the end of his poops. But one day he learned about fatburgs - A buildup of sewage that happens all over the country. A large contributing factor to this is flushable baby wipes. It turns out flushable does not mean decomposable, and they build up into these horrific creatures. He has since sworn off baby wipes and spreads the good word to anyone still using them.
